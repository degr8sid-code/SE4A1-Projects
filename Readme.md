The ScreenShots Folder have all the linux commands (dig, ping, tcpdump,mtr,netstat,nmap,iptables,tracroute) except airman and airdump as they were not correct and i reported the errors to you as well.
1.	Netstat:
The network statistics ( netstat ) command is a networking tool used for troubleshooting and configuration, that can also serve as a monitoring tool for connections over the network. Both incoming and outgoing connections, routing tables, port listening, and usage statistics are common uses for this command.

![sudo apt install net tools](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107847873/179368849-1cd6180e-68e0-4097-a09a-de36ada7e983.png)

2.	Nmap:
Nmap, or Network Mapper, is an open source Linux command line tool for network exploration and security auditing. With Nmap, server administrators can quickly reveal hosts and services, search for security issues, and scan for open ports.

3.	Tcpdump:
tcpdump is a packet analyzer that is launched from the command line. It can be used to analyze network traffic by intercepting and displaying packets that are being created or received by the computer it's running on.

4.	Ping:
The Linux ping command is a simple utility used to check whether a network is available and if a host is reachable. With this command, you can test if a server is up and running. It also helps with troubleshooting various connectivity issues.

5.	Mtr:
The mtr command is a combination of ping and traceroute commands. It is a network diagnostic tool that continuously sends packets showing ping time for each hop. It also displays network problems of the entire route taken by the network packets.

6.	Traceroute:
traceroute command in Linux prints the route that a packet takes to reach the host. This command is useful when you want to know about the route and about all the hops that a packet takes.

7.	Dig:
The dig command in Linux is used to gather DNS information. It stands for Domain Information Groper, and it collects data about Domain Name Servers. The dig command is helpful for troubleshooting DNS problems, but is also used to display DNS information.

8.	Iptables:
Iptables is a Linux command line firewall that allows system administrators to manage incoming and outgoing traffic via a set of configurable table rules. Iptables uses a set of tables which have chains that contain set of built-in or user defined rules.
