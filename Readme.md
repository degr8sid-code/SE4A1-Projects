OS Lab End Semester GitHub Actions (Building And Testing Java With Maven) project

## Java Maven

Maven is a build automation tools used primarily for Java projects. It is a powerful project management tool that is based on POM (Project Object Model). It is used for projects build, dependency and documentation.
> Maven makes a project easy to build also provides uniform build process (maven project can be shared by all the maven projects)


The common features of Maven are following:

1. Dependency management includes automation updating
2. Consistent usage across all projects
3. Instant access to new features with little or no extra configuration

## Prerequisites

- Java
- IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition

## Github Action
GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.

### Build Actions
Create maven.yml file in the workflow directory
