NODE JS

Node.js (Node) is an open source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side. Node is useful for developing applications that require a persistent connection from the browser to the server and is often used for real-time applications such as chat, news feeds and web push notifications.

PREREQUISITES

GITHUB ACTIONS

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD tool for the GitHub flow. You can use it to integrate and deploy code changes to a third-party cloud application platform as well as test, track, and manage code changes. GitHub Actions help you automate your software development workflows in the same place you store code and collaborate on pull requests and issues. You can write individual tasks, called actions, and combine them to create a custom workflow.

WORKFLOWS

A workflow is a configurable automated process that runs one or more jobs. You can see the workflow file created here is a YAML file.

EVENTS 

In every workflow created, you need to specify a specific event that triggers the workflow:

This snippet from the workflow indicates that the workflow will be run whenever a push or pull request is made to the main branch. 

JOBS

A job is a set of steps that a workflow should execute on the same runner.

RUNNERS

This indicates the server the job should run on.
