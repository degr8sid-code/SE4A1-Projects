OS Lab End Semester GitHub Actions (Building And Testing Java With Gradle) project
Java Gradle:
Gradle is an open-source build automation tool that is designed to be flexible enough to build almost any type of software. 
Gradle allows you to build any software, because it makes few assumptions about what you’re trying to build or how it should be done. The most notable restriction is that dependency management currently only supports Maven- and Ivy-compatible repositories and the filesystem.
